                                    education fosters the restoration of the lost image of God in human
                                    beings through the harmonious development of the physical, mental,
                                    social, and spiritual dimensions of life. The philosophy is
                                    manifested in the “3H” program of the University curriculum, which
                                    emphasizes the learners’ balanced and positive development of the
                                    Head, Heart, and Hand as they prepare for service here and for life
                                    in the hereafter.

                <p>
                    I was a stdent at international University of East Africa, but there
                              came an issue of tuition fee increment and I could not afford it
                              anymore so I needed another School and when I joined Bugema University
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I do not regret, I am enjoying everything here. Bugema is a very good
                              Institution. The order reason is that I wanted to specialise in
                              Computer Networking and I have heard Bugema University is very good at
                              Networking
