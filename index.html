            Bugema University holds as its philosophy the belief that true

            beings through the harmonious development of the physical, mental,
            social, and spiritual dimensions of life. The philosophy is
            manifested in the “3H” program of the University curriculum, which
            emphasizes the learners’ balanced and positive development of the
            Head, Heart, and Hand as they prepare for service here and for life
            in the hereafter.

          <h2>Reason I joined Bugema University</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          I was a stdent at international University of East Africa, but there
          came an issue of tuition fee increment and I could not afford it
          anymore so I needed another School and when I joined Bugema University
          <br />
          <br />
          I do not regret, I am enjoying everything here. Bugema is a very good
          Institution. The order reason is that I wanted to specialise in
          Computer Networking and I have heard Bugema University is very good at
          Networking
